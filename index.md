If you’re the one playing music while hanging out with friends or for a party, you want to be sure to play music that your audience will enjoy. With our app, we hope to create a DJing station that takes song suggestions from the crowd, and allows them to vote on which song to play next. It’s up to the designated DJ to mix and blend the songs together to keep the party going. We will be utilizing the Spotify API for playing songs and retrieving metadata, and the user interface will have screens for viewing and managing the queue, selecting and voting on songs, and the DJ will have a screen for adjusting playback parameters and mixing the two songs.
