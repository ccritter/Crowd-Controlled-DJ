# Crowd-Controlled-DJ
Suggest and vote on songs in the queue, and the designated DJ mixes them to keep the party going.

To install:
1. Download the source files
2. Open a terminal in the root directory of the project
3. Run 'npm install'
4. cd into /client
5. Run 'npm install'
6. In the client directory, create a file called '.env' and paste in the API key that I gave you.

To run:
1. Have two terminal windows open, one in the root directory of the project and one in /client
2. In the root directory terminal, run 'npm start'
3. In the client directory terminal, run 'npm start'
4. The browser should open up to the site, but if not, navigate to 'localhost:3000'

Style standards:
- I like having explicit semicolons
- Class method binding should be done in the constructor instead of as an arrow function. I'm willing to negotiate this but this is the standard I'm currently following.
- My IDE uses 2 space indents, so we may as well use that.
