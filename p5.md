### How to use:
1. Load the demo url
2. Wait a few seconds (I think there's some limitation with the free version of Heroku)
3. You should be good to go.

### In case the demo site breaks or if you want to build the code and run locally:
1. Go to the above GitHub URL
2. Follow the setup instructions
3. For the .env step, paste "REACT_APP_YT_API_KEY=AIzaSyA5UVJc3Q9qjWE7kcf8ivglwW702H1xCn0" into the file
4. Follow the running instructions

## Briefing
“We’re developing an app to allow users vote on the music selection on at social events.
The goal is for people to have more control over what music is played at any form of social gathering, whether it’s a large party or event, or just friends hanging out.

We need some input in designing the interface for the app. The purpose of this experiment is not meant to test you individually, but to test our work to ensure that our interface is easy to use and approachable. We’ll walk you through some basic tasks you can perform in the app with a paper prototype of the system, and ask you questions on how you would perform these tasks.
Do you consent to this experiment?

DJ’s host a room, and the other partygoers suggest and vote on songs to create a ranked list of suggestions for the DJ to work with. They can then mix in the suggested song, or one of their choosing, into the current song. Partygoers will work with the existing queue and a searchable library of songs on YouTube to help guide the music for the current event as they please. DJ will see their “deck” of what’s currently playing, the current queue of crowd suggestions, and a set of basic audio manipulation controls.

There are two sets of tasks we can run through -- one for a guest/partygoer, and one for the host/DJ.  Which would you like to act as?”

## Tasks
We had more than 3 tasks but they were pretty short/straightforward.

Host/DJ
1. Make a new room.
2. Search for and add a song to the queue.
3. Play a song from the queue.
4. Remove a song from the queue.
5. Play two songs at once.
6. Use the crossfader/volume, loop playback, and or playback speed controls to mix your songs.
7. Play two songs concurrently.
8. Adjust individual track volumes.
9. Try out “autoplay.”

(Note: for the guest tasks, you must have a separate tab open as a Host user, and then use the Room Code at the top right)

Guest/Partygoer
1. Join a room.
2. Search for and add a song to the queue.
3. Vote for a song in the queue.
