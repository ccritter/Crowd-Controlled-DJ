title: Crowd Controlled DJ - P2
---

## Problem
Whether at a party or hanging out with friends, you want to be sure to play music that your audience will enjoy. Also, sometimes the pause between songs can be an unfortunate pause to the energy of the room. With our app, we hope to create a DJ companion app that takes song suggestions from the crowd, and allows them to vote on which song to play next. The designated DJ can then mix and play the current song into the next, and if your group doesn’t have a DJ, that’s fine. The app will support autoplaying the songs together when one ends, until the suggestions run out.

## Users
### Primary: Adam - Aspiring DJ
Adam is a student at a local university, and enjoys hosting events for his friends.  He takes pride in organizing interesting and fun parties, and wants to make sure everyone that is invited is having a good time and feels welcome.  He listens to a lot of music in his free time between classes and while he relaxes, often makes playlists for each of the events and parties he hosts.  Adam is curious about learning how to DJ, though he’s always been hesitant due to the steep learning curve.  

### Primary: Brittany - Social Butterfly
Brittany is a classmate and friend of Adam’s, and admires his dedication to music. Brittany is much more of a social butterfly and enjoys hanging out with friends in a variety of situations. She is an enthusiastic music lover, but much prefers to simply listen to her playlists than attempt to create or mix songs of her own, like Adam. Brittany is very outgoing and takes every opportunity she can to get out, meet new people, hang out, and make friends, and one of the best ways she has found to connect with new people is their music preferences.

### Secondary: Clarissa - Audience Voter
Clarissa is Brittany’s introverted roommate. She spends a lot of her spare time listening privately to deep house music and searching for new and upcoming artists for the online blog she runs.  She often shares new music she likes with her close friends (Brittany included), whether via social media, online messaging platforms, or in person. Clarissa enjoys attending parties, events, and concerts to discover new music, but she is rather shy and reserved; she doesn’t tend to stay long if she goes alone. Many times she only really goes because Brittany drags her along, otherwise she would much rather stay at home and listen to music she knows she’ll enjoy.

### Tertiary: Dan - Non-voting Audience
Dan is a amicable student at a local university, and spends much of his time in the library or in group meetings.  He is a member of several on-campus clubs, and volunteers every week.  In between all of these activities, Dan likes to listen to newer hip-hop artists.  On the weekends, he enjoys attending parties and concerts with his friends as a way to relax and take his mind off of his large list of responsibilities -- though he rarely hosts anything himself. He already has enough on his plate with the many organizations he’s a part of.

## Tasks
### Task 1: Deciding to throw on some random playlist
This task is centered around being at some form of social gathering, and you’ve been designated as the “DJ” - i.e., the group has decided that your taste in music suits the general theme of the event, and wants you to put on a relevant playlist.  You decide to look through your playlists that you think fits the mood of the gathering, select one, and hope that it’s what the other people had in mind when they asked you to put on music.  This process is performed every time the playlist ends or you want to shift the mood of the party, or if some people don’t like what you’re playing.  No one else (or even you, for that matter) is really involved in the decision process unless they have a strong opinion about it.

### Task 2: Hand Picking each track to be added to the queue and played
The alternative to task 1 is hand picking each and every song, rather than placing the burden upon a predetermined playlist.  Assuming you have a selection of songs to work with, this scenario is much like that of task 1; you’ve likely been designated as the DJ for a social gathering, and must now pick songs to play for the crowd. You likely keep to a regimented ‘set’ of tracks, that flow smoothly from one to another, but occasionally you need to adapt to the mood of the room. You then search through your library during each song in hopes of finding the perfect song to follow up your current choice - one which mimics the emotions of both the previous song as well the dynamic emotion and vibe of the room you’re in.  This process is performed frequently -- every time you want to add another unforeseen song. This can go wrong by not having the next song ready in time, or hand picking songs that people don’t like. Again, no one else is involved unless they have a strong opinion or a specific request. And typically the audience doesn’t get a say in what songs play regardless.

### Task 3: Sitting through songs you don’t like
The reality of tasks 1 and 2 is that some of the songs being played may not be well-received by every audience member.  From the perspective of such an audience member, who is not in charge of the music, some of the songs may not fit the perceived mood of the event. In these cases, you simply do not have an option to change the song without what could potentially be a considerable amount of effort.  In a smaller setting, asking the person who is in charge of the music to skip that song is a perfectly feasible action. However, for larger events, the act of finding the DJ may be impossible in the amount of time the in question song would even be playing for, and the chance of successfully influencing the set is even less so.

## Problem Scenarios

### Task 1: Deciding to throw on some random playlist
Brittany is having her friends over for a dinner party, where they each signed up to cook different aspects of a fancy/complicated meal.  Just before they arrived, Brittany combed through her playlists and selected one featuring some of her favorite indie tracks for her and her friends to listen to while they cooked.  This went pretty well for quite some time, though her chosen playlist wasn’t very large, and Brittany’s music soon had looped and songs were being repeated.  She then had to stop her cooking to wash her hands and use her phone to change playlists to something new, to keep the repetitive songs from getting annoying.

### Task 2: Hand-picking each track to be added to the queue and played
Dan and his roommates are hosting a party for their college’s club volleyball team.  His roommates have decided to each take responsibility for different aspects of the event, and have left Dan with the task of playing the music for the night.  He unfortunately was not aware of this until moments before people began arriving, and so did not have time to adequately prepare and make a new playlist with some of the more recent songs that his volleyball team had been listening to at their practices.  Instead of asking around to find out who’s playlist is usually used during these practices, Dan decides to simply search and queue up all the songs he can think of that would be appropriate for his party.  

His queue, however, continues to run out during the night, forcing him to constantly be searching and queueing songs up for people to listen to.  This eventually starts to bother Dan, and he becomes frustrated that he had to spend the majority of the night managing the music instead of hanging out and relaxing with his friends and teammates.


### Task 3: Sitting through songs you don’t like
Clarissa introduces Brittany to electronic dance music (EDM), and they find that they both really enjoy the genre. One night, they decide to go to Adam’s house for a party he’s hosting.  The two of them are very excited, as their friend Adam has a similar taste in music (having introduced Clarissa to EDM), and he always plays the music for his parties. Unfortunately, when Britanny and Clarissa arrive, they find out that Adam is not in charge of the music, and in fact his roommate Evan is picking the songs while Adam is away.

Evan is that special kind of person that nobody likes. Nobody likes Evan.

Evan, unlike Adam, only listens to shitty rap music, which is not a genre the girls keep up with. Both Brittany and Clarissa end up leaving far earlier than they expected due to their dislike of the playlist that was selected.

## Usability Requirements

### Ease/Learnability of Manual Mode
With a simple, familiar, and identifiable user interface we hope that complete beginners and experienced DJs alike can make use of our app. To make sure that our buttons, icons, and layouts are identifiable, we can research current professional DJ software and simplify the general design to be more intuitive. To test that our system is easy to pick up, we can ask participants (regardless of initial skill level) to attempt a reasonably easy of steps: finding and blending between specific songs from a playlist, in a different order than presented. Afterwards, we can allow the participants to ‘play around’ with the system - familiarize themselves with it as much as they see fit in the time allotted. Finally, we can ask them to perform yet another similar set of steps to the initial set, and measure their comparisons between beginning and end - how smooth the transitions were, how comfortable they were with performing the required actions, and the speed/efficiency with which these actions were performed. Time permitting, we can also bring the same participants back on a separate day for a shorter, similar round of tests to see how much knowledge of the system they have retained.

### Smoothness of Autoplay Mode
Listeners at an event where this service is being used should not be able to tell when the active DJ stops taking deliberate actions and the system turns on autoplay mode to transition between songs and act upon the crowd’s voting. This may be difficult to tell accurately if the designated DJ was either really good or really bad at mixing songs, depending on how well our system ends up handling it. To test this, we can run the auto play mode, and between every song, survey the crowd: Respond yes if you thought the transition was smooth/acceptable, respond no if it was too jarring/abrupt/mismatched. After 5-10 song transitions, average the yes percentages of each transition and if it is higher than 60% then autoplay is a success.

### Fairness of and Satisfaction with Voting
When prompted with a brief questionnaire at the end of an event where this service is used, users should score at least a 50% with respect to the fairness and satisfaction of the voting capabilities.  The questionnaire will ask whether or not they searched for a song to suggest, if they voted on any previously suggested songs, if anything they suggested or voted for ended up being played, and if they felt that the voting system provided a fair approach to crowdsourcing the playlist.
